<h1>Fixing number lists</h2>

<p>In large or complex documents number lists can sometimes be broken, especially when extending over different headings and other content. Here's how to fix them.</p>

<p>In the example snip below we have a numbered lists extending over headings which we want to all be connected together. Note: Some are connected, some are not.</p>

To have all these numbers run sequentially together, right click the number that is not following on from the last and select <strong>Continue Numbering</strong> from the menu.

You can also set a custom number for a numbered list to start on via <strong>Set Numbering value</strong> which brings up this window:

Once done you should see the numbered lists continuing on as appropriate (Note: the numbers below the last heading that were sequential will adapt accordingly):
