<h1>Moving content</h1>

There are different ways to move content in Windows and Microsoft Office apps. The main methods are <strong>dragging</strong> and <strong>cut and paste</strong>.


<h2>Dragging</h2> 
Dragging, also referred to as 'drag and drop' or 'click and drag', is where you select a file or content holding down left click and move the mouse/mousepad to another location.

<h2>Cut and paste</h2> 
<p>Cutting and pasting is where you copy content to the clipboard while removing ('cutting') it from its original location, to then duplicate ('paste') it elsewhere.</p>

<p>For content in applications, the content is removed when cut.</p>
<p>For files, they are removed from their original location once pasted into the new location.</p>
